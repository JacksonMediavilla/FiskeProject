# FiskeProject

The 'getShows.py' script accesses the event data for the upcoming shows at Fiske Planetarium and notifies the user if any shows have
been added or modified since the script's last execution.  
  
You may choose to execute this script on command or on a regular basis by using a task scheduler.
